Fade into You by Mazzy Star


A        E         Bm
I wanna hold the hand inside you
A        E         Bm
i wanna take the breath's that true
A        E         Bm
i look to you and i see nothing
A        E         Bm
i look to you to see the truth
A            E               Bm
You live your life, you go in shadow 
A           E                  Bm
you'll come apart and you'll go black
A            E              Bm
some kind of night into your darkness
A           E                 Bm
colors your eyes with what's not there


A      E    Bm
F-----ade into you 
A     E              Bm
S----trange you never knew
A      E    Bm     D
F-----ade into you
A           E                Bm
i think it's strange you never knew


A           E             Bm
the strange light comes on slowly
A            E              Bm
a stranger's heart without a home
A            E              Bm
you put your hands into your head
A        E               Bm
and with smiles cover your heart
 
A       E      Bm
F-------ade into you 
A       E       Bm
strange you never knew
A       E      Bm    D

A       E       Bm
strange you never knew
A       E      Bm    D

A           E                Bm
i think it's strange you never knew
A           E                Bm
i think it's strange you never knew
