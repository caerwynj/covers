G
 
       G        D      Em
At the dark end of the street,
       G        D      Em
that's where we always meet
          G
Hiding in shadows,
         C     D G
where we don't belong
          C
Living in darkness,
   D        G
to hide our wrong
 
C       G
You and me, at the
C        D      G
dark end of the street
C       G   D
You and me
 
       G
I know time is,
      D         Em
Gonna take it's toll
           G
We have to pay for
    D            Em
the love that we stole
       G
It's a sin and
   C    D    G
we know it's wrong
            C
Oh, but our love,
      D         G
keeps coming on strong
 
C      G
Steal away, to the
C        D      G
dark end of the street
C       G   D
Ummmmmmmm
 
                 G
They're gonna to find us
                 D
They're gonna to find us
                 Em
They're gonna to find us
C         G
Lord, someday
 
C       G
You and me, at the
C        D      G
dark end of the street
C       G
You and me
 
Ab
And when the
Ab             Eb     Fm
daylight hours rolls around
       Ab
And by chance,
      Eb       Fm
we're both downtown
 
             Ab
If we should meet,
     Db      Ab
just walk on by
Fm   Db      Eb           Ab
Oh, darling, please don't cry
 
  Fm           Ab
Tonight, we'll meet, at
    Fm       Eb     Ab      Db      Ab
the dark end of the street, you and me
