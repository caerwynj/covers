Black Hole Sun by Chris Cornell, Soundgarden

DADGBE

[Verse 1]
 
      G          Bb
In my eyes, indisposed
      F                Em
In disguise as no one knows
          Eb              D
Hides the face, lies the snake
    G      F      Ab
The sun in my disgrace
        G            Bb
Boiling heat, summer stench
           F                   Em
'Neath the black the sky looks dead
        Eb                D
Call my name through the cream
         G          F      Ab
And I'll hear you scream again
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
          D
Won't you come
    G      F        Bb
And wash away the rain
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
           D
Won't you come
           Csus2           D
Won't you come  Won't you come
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
      G               Bb
Stuttering, cold and damp
          F                Em
Steal the warm wind tired friend
          Eb              D
Times are gone for honest men
               G      F        Ab
And sometimes far too long for snakes
      G                Bb
In my shoes, a walking sleep
       F               Em
And my youth I pray to keep
       Eb          D
Heaven send Hell away
       G          F      Ab
No one sings like you anymore
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
          D
Won't you come
    G      F        Bb
And wash away the rain
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
           D
Won't you come
           Csus2    Bbsus2
Won't you come
 
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
          D
Won't you come
    G      F        Bb
And wash away the rain
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
           D
Won't you come
           Csus2
Won't you come
 
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
           Csus2
Won't you come
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
           Csus2
Won't you come
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
           Csus2
Won't you come
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G                       Bb
Hang my head, drown my fear
         F           Em
Till you all just disappear
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
          D
Won't you come
    G    F        Bb
And wash away the rain
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
           D
Won't you come
          Csus2    Bbsus2
Won't you come
 
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
          D
Won't you come
    G      F        Bb
And wash away the rain
           Ebsus4
Black hole sun
           D
Won't you come
           Csus2
Won't you come
 
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
           Csus2
Won't you come
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
           Csus2
Won't you come
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
           Csus2
Won't you come
           Bbsus2          D
Black hole sun  Black hole sun
