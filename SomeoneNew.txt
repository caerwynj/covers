G Bm C  D
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
G               Bm  C               D
Go take this the wrong way
(slide)Em      D*        Bm   C
You knew who I was every step that I ran to you
G         Bm C          D
Only blue or black days
(slide) Em           D*             Bm         C
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
 
 
[Bridge]
C7*                Bm                    (slide) Em
    Would things be easier if there was a right way
D*      Bm           C
Honey there is no right way
 
 
[Chorus]
 1
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                   Bm    C            D
There's an art to life's distractions
slide Em            D*                   Bm         C
To somehow escape the burning wait the art of scraping through
G         Bm   C      D
Some like to imagine
slide Em            D*              Bm         C
The dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C7*                 Bm                    (slide) Em
    Would things be easier if there was a right way

Honey there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
         G                              Bm
And so I fall in love just a little oh a little bit
C                      D
every day with someone new
 
 
[Bridge 2]
 
Am                            Em
I wake at the first cringe of morning
C7  B7       Em*
And my heart's already sinned.
C7                  B7         Em*
How pure, sweet a love Aretha, that you would pray for him
 
 
[Bridge 3]
