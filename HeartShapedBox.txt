[Intro]
A5  F5  D5    A5  F5  D
 
[Verse]
A    F          D           A   F     D
 She eyes me like a pisces when I am weak
A          F          D                     A   F    D
 I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
A          F        D              A  F    D
 I've been drawn into your magnet tarpit trap
A       F        D                A   F         D
 I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black
 
[Chorus]
A5    F5    D
  Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint,
A5   F5       D5
  forever in debt to your priceless advice
A5    F5    D
  Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint,
A5   F5       D5
  forever in debt to your priceless advice
A5    F5    D

  Your advice
 
[Verse]
 A     F      D               A  F         D
  Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
 A      F       D              A F      D
  Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath
 A       F       D              A   F      D
  Broken hymen of your highness I'm left black
 A      F           D                     A    F        D
  Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back
 
[Chorus]
A5    F5    D
  Hey! Wait! I got a new complaint,
A5   F5       D5
  forever in debt to your priceless advice
