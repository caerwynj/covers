[Intro]
 
        Bmaj7    B7      Emaj7       (x2)
              Do do-do-do do  do
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
           Bmaj7               B7                Emaj7
        As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
               Bmaj7                           Amaj7
        And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
               Bmaj7                   B7
        Just as hate knows love's the cure
               Emaj7
        You can rest your mind assure
             G#m            A#m D#7 G#m7 G#m6 C#m7 F#7
        That I'll be loving you always
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
        As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
        But in passing will grow older every day
        Just as all is born is new
        Do know what I say is true
             G#m            A#m D#7 (G#m)
        That I'll be loving you  always
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        G#m          D#7/A#              B              C#
          (Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
        Always
        G#m         D#7/A#         B              C#
          (Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
        Always
        G#m         D#7/A#              B              C#
          (Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
        G#m         D#7/A#             B            (F9 to bridge)
        Always                                      (others: C#)
          (Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)
 
 
[Bridge]
 
        Emaj7                                      Bmaj7
              Did you know that true love asks for nothing
        Emaj7                             Dmaj9
              Her acceptance is the way we pay
        Emaj7                                 Bmaj7
              Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
           C#m7                            A#m7/D# D#7 C#m9 F#13
        To last through forever and another day            (just)
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
        Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
        And the seasons know exactly when to change
        Just as kindness knows no shame
        Know through all your joy and pain
        That I'll be loving you always
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
        As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
        Could make me that past but that I mustn't fear
        For I'll know deep in my mind
        The love of me I've left behind
        'Cause I'll be loving you always
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
[Chorus chord progression continues to fade]
 
        Until the day is night and night becomes the day
        Until the trees and sea just up and fly away
        Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
        Until the day that is the day that are no more
 
 
[Chorus]
 
        Until the day the earth starts turning right to left
        Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
        Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through
        Until the day that you are me and I am you
 
 
[Repeat first two lines of chorus 1]
 
 
[Piano Solo]
 
 
[Interlude]
 
        We all know sometimes life's hate and troubles
        Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
        But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
        That God knew exactly where He wanted you to be placed
        So make sure when you say you're in it but not of it
        You're not helping to make this Earth a place sometimes called Hell
        Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
        And maybe our children's grandchildren
        And their great-great-grandchildren will tell
 
        I'll be loving you...
 
 
[Repeat choruses 1, 2, 3]
 
        Always...
