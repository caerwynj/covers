[Verse]
F         C/E          Dm       C          Bb
I'm gonna make a change,    for once in my life
           F         C/E               Dm          C             Bb
It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
     F        C/E         Dm            C           Bb
As I, turn up the collar on  my favorite winter coat, this wind is blowin' my mind
          F            C/E         Dm                 C           
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
          Bb
Who am I, to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
Gm7                  F/A
 A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
Bb                F/A
 And a one man's soul
     Gm7                      F/A
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
            Bb                 C
'Cause they got nowhere to go
                              F
That's why I want you to know
 
[Chorus]
F    F/A               Bb          C
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
F    F/A            Bb          C
 I'm asking him to change his ways
F       F/A                Bb        G/B
 And no message could have been any clearer
         Cm
 If you wanna make the world a better place
                                               F  C/E
 Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
 
[Bridge]
Dm         C                 Bb                 C
  Na na na,  na na na na, na na, na na, uh-huh
 
[Verse]
F         C/E          Dm       C          Bb
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love, It's time that I realize
           F         C/E               Dm 
There are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
C             Bb
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?
 
Gm7                  F/A
 A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
Bb                F/A
 And a washed-out dream
     Gm7                      F/A
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
            Bb                 C
'Cause they got no place to be
                              F
That's why I'm starting with me
 
[Chorus]
[Chorus[

 
[Key-Change]

F#
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
 I'm asking him to change his ways
 No message could have been any clearer
 If you wanna make the world a better place
 Take a look at yourself and then make the change
 You gotta get it right, while you got the time
 'Cause when you close your heart
 
[Bridge]

If you wanna make the world a better place
                                           Ab     Eb/G
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
Fm         Eb                Db        Eb     Ab     Eb/G
  Na na na,  na na na na, na na, na na,   oh yeah
