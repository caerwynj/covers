[Intro]
 
Em7 G/F# G Cadd9
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em7     G/F#         G
Another day, another life 
       Cadd9        Em7
Passes by just like mine 
         G/F#        G     Cadd9
It's not complicated 
 
Em7     G/F#          G
Another mind, another soul 
        Cadd9        Em7
Another body to grow old 
         G/F#        G     Cadd9
It's not complicated 
 
Cadd9                     D
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G     G/F#
Float down
Em7  Cadd9
Like autumn leaves 
G    G/F#
Hush now 
Em7             Cadd9
Close your eyes before the sleep
G          G/F#      Em7   Cadd9     G
And you're miles away, and yesterday 
G/F#     Em7       Cadd9
You were here with me 
 
 
[Interlude]
 
Em7 G/F# G Cadd9
Em7 G/F# G Cadd9
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em7     G/F#          G
Another tear, another cry 
        Cadd9           Em7
Another place for us to die 
         G/F#        G     Cadd9
It's not complicated 
 
Em7     G/F#                G
Another life that's gone to waste 
        Cadd9                Em7
Another light lost from your face 
     G/F#       G      Cadd9
It's complicated 
 
Cadd9                      D
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G     G/F#
Float down
Em7  Cadd9
Like autumn leaves 
G    G/F#
Hush now 
Em7             Cadd9
Close your eyes before the sleep
G          G/F#      Em7   Cadd9     G
And you're miles away, and yesterday 
G/F#     Em7       Cadd9
You were here with me 
 
 
[Bridge]
 
A7sus4     Cadd9
Ooh, how I miss you 
   G                   D
My symphony played the song that carried you out 
A7sus4    Cadd9
Ooh how I miss you 
   G              D
I miss you and I wish you'd stay 
 
Cadd9                     D
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G     G/F#
Float down
Em7  Cadd9
Like autumn leaves 
G    G/F#
Hush now 
Em7             Cadd9
Close your eyes before the sleep
G          G/F#      Em7   Cadd9     G
And you're miles away, and yesterday 
G/F#     Em7       Cadd9
You were here with me 
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em7     G   G/F#
Ooh oh, ooh oh 
Em7     G   G/F#
Ooh oh, ooh oh 
 
 
[Outro]
 
G     G/F#     Em7
Touch down 
       Cadd9
Like a seven four seven 
G    G/F# Em7      A7sus4
Stay out and we'll live forever now
