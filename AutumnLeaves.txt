Tuning: EABGBe (capo 3rd fret)
[Intro]
Em7 G/F# G Cadd9

[Verse] 
Em7     G/F#         G
Another day, another life 
       Cadd9        Em7
Passes by just like mine 
         G/F#        G     Cadd9
It's not complicated 
 
Em7     G/F#          G
Another mind, another soul 
        Cadd9        Em7
Another body to grow old 
         G/F#        G     Cadd9
It's not complicated 
 
Cadd9                     D
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
 
[Chorus]
G     G/F#
Float down
Em7  Cadd9
Like autumn leaves 
G    G/F#
Hush now 
Em7             Cadd9
Close your eyes before the sleep
G          G/F#      Em7   Cadd9     G
And you're miles away, and yesterday 
G/F#     Em7       Cadd9
You were here with me 

[Interlude] 
Em7 G/F# G Cadd9
Em7 G/F# G Cadd9

[Verse]
Another tear, another cry 
Another place for us to die 
It's not complicated 
Another life that's gone to waste 
Another light lost from your face 
It's complicated 
 
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? 
 
[Chorus] 
[Bridge]
 
A7sus4     Cadd9
Ooh, how I miss you 
   G                   D
My symphony played the song that carried you out 
A7sus4    Cadd9
Ooh how I miss you 
   G              D
I miss you and I wish you'd stay 
 
Cadd9                     D
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? 
 
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
 
Em7     G   G/F#
Ooh oh, ooh oh 
Em7     G   G/F#
Ooh oh, ooh oh 
 
 
[Outro]
 
G     G/F#     Em7
Touch down 
       Cadd9
Like a seven four seven 
G    G/F# Em7      A7sus4
Stay out and we'll live forever now
