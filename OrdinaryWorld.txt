Ordinary World - Duran Duran
 
[Verse one]
Bm                              D                      E
Came in from a rainy Thursday   on the avenue
Bm                                      D              E
Thought I heard you talking softly
Bm                              D              E
I turned on the lights, the TV and the radio
Bm                                      D      E
Still I can’t escape the ghost of       you
Bm
What is happening to it all
F#m
Crazy some say
C#                             D
Where is the life that I        recognise?      Gone away
 
[Chorus]
A                          Em7
But I won’t cry for yesterday
                        G6sus4/C  G6/B                  Dsus4
There’s an ordinary     world somehow   I have to       find
A                       Em7                 G6sus4/C
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
       G6/B          D
I will learn to survive
 
[Verse two]
Bm                              D                   E
Passion or coincidence once     prompted you to say
Bm                              D              E
Pride will tear us both apart
                Bm
Well now        pride’s gone out the window
                D                  E
Cross the       rooftops, runaway
Bm                              D              E
Left me in the vacuum of my     heart
Bm
What is happening to me
F#m
Crazy some'll say
C#                        D
Where is my friend when I need you most?        Gone away
 
 
[Chorus]
A                            Em7
But I won’t cry for yesterday
                        G6sus4/C        G6/B            Dsus4
There’s an ordinary     world somehow   I have to       find
A                       Em7                 G6sus4/C
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
        G6/B          D
I will learn to survive
 
[Instrumental]
A      Em   G6/C   G6/B   Dsus4
A      Em   G6/C   G6/B   Gm/Bb
Bm      D      E      Bm     D      E      Bm     D      E      Bm     D      E
Bm      F#     C#m    D
 
[Verse three]
Bm                                      D         E
Papers in the roadside tell of  suffering and   greed
Bm                              D      E
Feared today forgot tomorrow
Bm                              D              E
Here beside the news of holy    war and holy    need
Bm                              D      E
Ours is just a little sorrow talk
 
[Chorus]
A                         Em7
But I won’t cry for yesterday
                        G6/C            G6/B      D
There’s an ordinary     world somehow   I have to find
A                       Em7                  G6/C
And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world
        G6/B           D
I will learn to survive
A                       Em7
Every world is my world (I will learn to survive)
A                       Em7
Any world is my world   (I will learn to survive)
A                       Em7
Any world is my world   (I will learn to survive)
A                       Em7
Every world is my world (I will learn to survive)
