Place to be  by Nick Drake

UNING: D A D G A F#
Capo 3rd Fret
 
 
[Intro]
 
D  Em/F#  D  Em/F#
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Em/F#                D
When I was young, younger than before
Em/F#                        D
I never saw the truth hanging from the door
F#m            Em/F#
And now I'm older see it face to face
F#m               Em/F#            D
And now I'm older gotta get up clean the place
D Em/F#  D  Em/F#
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
And I was green, greener than the hill
Where flowers grow and the sun shone still
Now I'm darker than the deepest sea
Just hand me down, give me place to be
 
[Solo]
 
[Verse 3]
 
And I was strong, strong in the sun
I thought I'd see when day was done
Now I'm weaker than the palest blue
Oh so weak in this need for you

NOTE: While playing D, constantly hammer on and off the second fret note
of the G string.  With Em/F#, the second fret note of the lowest D string
is hammered on, then the second fret note of the A string is often
hammered on too.  There is much more going on in this song, particularly
the solo, but I figured something is better than nothing.  Maybe I'll get
back and do a more detailed version one of these days- anyone else who
wants to try is very welcome to.
