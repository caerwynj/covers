Capo: 3rd fret

 
[Intro]
G Em7 Cadd9 G D
 
[Verse 1]
Cadd9
Heartbeats fast
           G
Colors and promises
          Em7
How to be brave
          D              Cadd9
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
                 G
But watching you stand alone
          Em7            D             Am
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
         Em7 D
One step closer
 
[Chorus]
G                     Dsus4   D/F#
I have died every day waiting for you
Em7                     Dsus4  D/F#
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
       Cadd9
For a thousand years
                 D/F#     D
I love you for a thousand more
 
[Verse 2]
Cadd9
Time stands still
          G
Beauty in all she is
          Em7
I will be brave
           D   D/F#     Cadd9
I will not let anything take away
                   G
What's standing in front of me
      Em7
Every breath
      D        D/F#    Am
Every hour has come to this
         Em7 D
One step closer
 
[Chorus]
G                     Dsus4   D/F#
I have died every day waiting for you
Em7                     Dsus4   D/F#
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
       Cadd9
For a thousand years
                 D/F#     D
I love you for a thousand more
 
[Bridge]
G                     Dsus4   D/F#
And all along I believed I would find you
Em7
Time has brought your heart to me
Dsus4  D/F#            Cadd9
I have loved you for a thousand years
                 D/F#     D
I love you for a thousand more
 
[Instrumental]

         Em7 D     Am
One step closer
         Em7 D
One step closer
 
[Chorus]
G                     Dsus4   D/F#
I have died every day waiting for you
Em7                     Dsus4   D/F#
Darling don't be afraid I have loved you
       Cadd9
For a thousand years
                 D/F#     D
I love you for a thousand more
 
[Outro]
G                     Dsus4   D/F#
And all along I believed I would find you
Em7
Time has brought your heart to me
Dsus4  D/F#            Cadd9
I have loved you for a thousand years
                 D/F#     D
I love you for a thousand more
