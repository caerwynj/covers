[Intro]
G  Am  Em  C  G
Time signature 6/8
Capo 2
 
[Verse 1]
G
Be, be as you've always been
                                     Am
Be like the love that discovered the sin
                                         Em
That freed the first man and will do so again
               C       G
And, lover, be good to me
G
Be that hope when Eden was lost
                                                    Am
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed
                                           Em
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
               C       G
And, lover, be good to me
 
 
[Chorus]
Asus2 Am                 G      Em
Be             as you've always been
Asus  Am                 G      Em       D
Be             as you've always been
 
 
[Verse 2]
G
Be, be as you've always been
                                           Am
True to the time and the placе you've been given
                                               Em
Your heart in thе world, and a world there within
               C       G
And, lover, be good to me
G
Be there and just as you stand
                                            Am
Or be like the rose that you'd hold in your hand
                                          Em
That grows bold in a barren and an uneasy land
               C       G
And, lover, be good to me
 
 
[Chorus]
     Asus2  Am                 G      Em
And, be              as you've always been
Asus   Am                G      Em
Be             as you've always been
Asus2  Am                G      Em
Be             as you've always been
Asus   Am                G      Em      D
Be             as you've always been
