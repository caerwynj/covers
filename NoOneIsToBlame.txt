No One Is To Blame by Howard Jones


[Intro]
Both the "A" and the "E" should be picked starting with the bass note on down,
then add the "sus4" with your pinky when you reach it. Listen to the keyboard part on the
track, and you'll get it.

This is the main riff in the song. Played with a down strum on each of the notes. When you hit
the "E" arpeggiate a few of the notes before going back into the "A" again.

[Verse 1]
A                                 E
You can look at the menu, but you just can't eat
D                                              A
You can feel the cushion, but you can't have a seat
                                           E
You can dip your foot in the pool, but you can't have a swim
D                                                     A
You can feel the punishment, but you can't commit the sin
 
[Chorus]
        E              D             D      A/C# Bm A
And you want her, and she wants you, we want everyone
        E             D
And you want her, and she wants you
D  A/C# Bm A/C#   Bm        E            A  F#m E   A  F#m E
No one, no one, no one ever...is to blame
 
[Verse 2]
A                                     E
You can build a mansion, but you just can't live in it
D                                                   A
You're the fastest runner but you're not allowed to win
                                  E
Some break the rules, and live to count the cost
D                                F#m       A
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost
 
[Chorus]
        E              D             D      A/C# Bm   A
And you want her, and she wants you, we want everyone
        E             D
And you want her, and she wants you
D  A/C# Bm A/C#   Bm        E            A  F#m E   A  F#m E
No one, no one, no one ever...is to blame
 
[Verse 3]
A                                E
You can see the summit but you can't reach it
D                                        F#m        D       A
Its the last piece of the puzzle but you just can't make it fit
                                       E
Doctor says you're cured but you still feel the pain
D                                  F#m      D        A
Aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the drain
 
[Chorus]
        E              D             D       A/C# Bm   A
And you want her, and she wants you, we want everyone
        E             D
And you want her, and she wants you
D  A/C# Bm A/C#    Bm        E        F#m   B
No one, no one, no one ever...is to blame
Bm          E         F#m   B
No one ever... is to blame
Bm7         E (let ring)  A   F#m E   A F#m E
No one ever... is to blame
