Sorry by Halsey

Capo: 1st fret


[Intro]
C    Am7
Em   G/D D
 
[Verse 1]
     C
I've missed your calls for months it seems
      Am7                      G/B
Don't realize how mean I can be
      Em
'Cause I can sometimes treat the people
G/D              D
That I love like jewelry
       C
'Cause I can change my mind each day
  Am7
I didn't mean to try you on
    Em
But I still know your birthday
         D
And your mother's favorite song
 
 
[Chorus]
       Am
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
C                   G/B
Sorry that I can't believe
     Em
That anybody ever really
G
Starts to fall in love with me
Am
Sorry to my unknown lover
C                   G/B
Sorry I could be so blind
Em
Didn't mean to leave you
           G
And all of the things that we had behind
Am  Am/B C
Ooh
C   G/B  Em
Ooh
Em  G
Ooh
 
 
[Verse 2]
  C
I run away when things are good
    Am                 Am7
And never really understood
    Em
The way you laid your eyes on me
   G/D              D          Bm7
In ways that no one ever could
    C
And so it seems I broke your heart
    Am7
My  ignorance has struck again
  Em
I failed to see it from the start
    D
And tore you open 'til the end
 
 
[Chorus]
       Am
So I'm sorry to my unknown lover
C                   G/B
Sorry that I can't believe
     Em
That anybody ever really
G
Starts to fall in love with me
Am
Sorry to my unknown lover
C                   G/B
Sorry I could be so blind
Em
Didn't mean to leave you
           G
And all of the things that we had behind
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
Am                           Am/B
   And someone will love you
C               G/B
   Someone will love you
Em
   Someone will love you
G
   But someone isn't me
Am                           Am/B
   And someone will love you
C               G/B
   Someone will love you
Em
   Someone will love you
G
   But someone isn't me
 
 
[Chorus]
       Am
