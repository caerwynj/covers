Say Something by A Great Big World & Christina Aguilera


[Intro]
| Bm    | Bm    |
| Bm    | G     | D     | Asus4 |
 
[Chorus]
Bm                G                   D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Bm                 G                  D       Asus4
   I'll be the one, if you want me to.
Bm           G                      D       Asus4
   Anywhere, I would've followed you.
Bm                G                   D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
 
[Verse 1]
    D                F#m
And I am feeling so small.
        Gsus2
It was over my head
                  D     Asus4
I know nothing at all.
 
    D                  F#m
And I will stumble and fall.
            Gsus2
I'm still learning to love
                 D     Asus4
Just starting to crawl.
 
[Chorus]
Bm                Gsus2               D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Bm                Gsus2                 D       Asus4
   I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.
Bm           Gsus2                  D       Asus4
   Anywhere, I would've followed you.
Bm                Gsus2               D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
 
[Verse 2]
    D                 F#m
And I will swallow my pride.
            Gsus2
You're the one that I love
                   D        Asus4
And I'm saying goodbye.
 
[Chorus]
Bm                Gsus2               D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Bm                    Gsus2                D       Asus4
   And I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you.
Bm               Gsus2                 D/A       Asus4
   And anywhere, I would've followed you.
Bm                Gsus2               D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
 
Bm                Gsus2               D       Asus4
   Say something, I'm giving up on you.
Bm               Gsus2    D
   Say something
