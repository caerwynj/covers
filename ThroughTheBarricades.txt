Through the Barricades by Spandau Ballet


[Intro]
G  Em  Bm  Bm7
C  Em  F   C  Cm   D
 
 
[Verse 1]
G                Em                  Bm7
  Mother doesn't know where love has gone
C             Em                 F                C
  She says it must be youth that keeps us feeling strong
G                 Em                 Bm7
  I see it in her face that's turned to ice
C              Em                   F             D
  and when she smiles she shows the lines of sacrifice
 
 
[Chorus]
          C                 D             G             Em
And now I know what they're sayin' as our sun begins to fade
       C                Am   C        D             G
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades
 
 
[Verse 2]
G        Em          Bm7
  Father made my history
C               Em                    F             C
  He fought for what he thought would set us somehow free
G              Em             Bm7
  He taught me what to say in school
C              Em               F                  D
  I learned it off by heart but now that's torn in two
 
 
[Chorus]
          C                 D             G              Em
And now I know what they're sayin' in the music of the parade
       C                Am   C        D             F
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades
 
 
[Instrumental]
F  C  G
 
 
[Verse 3]
G          Em                 Bm7
  Born on different sides of life
C    Em                F                C
  We fear the same and feel all of this strife
G            Em           Bm7
  So come to me when I'm asleep (asleep)
C       Em                  F            D
  We'll cross the lines and dance upon the streets
 
 
[Chorus]
          C                 D             G              Em
And now I know what they're sayin' as the drums begin to fade
       C                Am   C        D            G
And we made our love on wasteland and through the barricades
 
 
[Bridge]
F     C                       G
  Oh, turn around and I'll be there
              F                     C                   G
Oh, there's a scar right through my heart but I'll bear it again
      F                          C
Oh, I thought we were the human race
            G                       Em
but we were just another borderline case
        C
And the stars reach down and tell us
                     D
there's always one escape
 
 
[Verse 4]
 G          D/F#                  Em
Oh, I don't know where love has gone
C                 Em             C                D
  But in this troubled land desperation keeps us strong
G          D/F#             Em
  Friday's child is full of soul
C              Em                   C           D
  With nothing left to lose there's everything to go
 
 
[Chorus]
      C                 D              G                  Em
Now I know what they're sayin', it's a terrible beauty we've made
      C                Am   C        D             G
So we make our love on wasteland and through the barricades
 
          C                 D             Em       D     C
And now I know what they're sayin' as our hearts go to their graves
       C                Am   C            D                 F
And we made our love on wasteland, oh and through the barricades
