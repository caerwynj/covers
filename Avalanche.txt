 you were a whisper in the night
      C
and i loved you for a summer
Bb       C               Dm
 but now the garden of delight
     F
lies under snow cover..

Bb    C            Dm
 sail on in my memory..
     C                  Bb
i'll wave from the shoreline..

disembarking on an avalanche..
           Dm

Bb          C                Dm
 we were a star-crossed fantasy
         C
that was never gonna hold us
Bb      C           Dm
 or our future histories
          F
but maybe it was just to mould us
