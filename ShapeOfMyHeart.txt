The Shape of My Heart by Sting

[VERSE 1/2]
Em               Bm7          Asus2       Bsus4   B7
  He deals the cards,    as a meditation,
Em/C           Bm7             Asus2      Bsus4   B7
  and those he plays, never suspect,
Cmaj7                            Gsus2 G5        B7
    he doesnt play,      for the mo  - ney he wins,
Cmaj7         Esus2sus4         Em
    he doesnt play    for   respect.
Em               Bm7             Asus2     Bsus4  B7
  He deals the cards to find the answer,
Em/C             Bm7           Asus2      Bsus4   B7
    the sacred geometry of chance,
Cmaj7                        Gsus2  G5    B7
    the hidden law,       of a pro -  bable outcome,
Cmaj7           Esus2sus4     Em
    the numbers lead   a   dance.
 
 
[CHORUS 1]
Em                 Bm7                 Asus2        Bsus4 B7
   I know that the spades,    are the swords of a soldier,
Em/C                Bm7                  Asus2      Bsus4 B7
   I know that the clubs are weapons of war,
Cmaj7                             Gsus2 G5            B7
   I know that diamonds,     mean mo -  ney for this art,
       Cmaj7         Esus2sus4     Em
   but thats not the shape of my heart.
 
 
[VERSE 3]
Em             Bm7              Asus2     Bsus4  B7
   And he may play the jack of diamonds,
Em/C        Bm7              Asus2     Bsus4   B7
   he may lay the queen of spades,
Cmaj7                   Gsus2  G5     B7
   he may conceal,    a king   in his hand,
Cmaj7         Esus2sus4       Em
    while a memory of it fades.

   I know that the spades,    are the swords of a soldier,
Em/C               Bm7                  Asus2       Bsus4   B7
   I know that the clubs are weapons of war,
Cmaj7                          Gsus2 G5            B7
   I know that diamonds,  mean mo -  ney for this art,
       Cmaj7         Esus2sus4      Em        Em7
   but thats not the shape   of my heart,
    Cmaj7         Esus2sus4               (Middle 8 start)

[VERSE 4]
Em           Bm7              Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   And if I told you that I loved you,
Em/C           Bm7                    Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   you'd maybe think theres something wrong,
Cmaj7                   Gsus2 G5    B7
   I'm not a man,    of two   many faces,
Cmaj7         Esus2sus4    Em
   the mask I wear   is    one.
Em                    Bm7         Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   But those who speak know nothing,
Em/C   Bm7                Asus2    Bsus4  B7
   and find out to their cost,
Cmaj7                                  Gsus2 G5   B7
   and those who curse their luck, in  too  many places,
Cmaj7            Esus2sus4  Em
   are those who fear  are  lost.
