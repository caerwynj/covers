Guess mine is not the first heart broken
   Em7              A7       Dmaj7       D6
My eyes are not the first to cry
    D                B7          C6              B7  Em7   Em7  F#m7  Fm7  Em7
I'm not the first to know there's just no gettin' over you
 
  D               F#m7       G         G
I know I'm just a fool who's willing
   Em7            A7       Dmaj7       D6
To sit around and wait for you
     D               B7         C6               B7   Em7   Em7
But, baby, can't you see there's nothin' else for me to do
    F#m7       Fm7  Em7      Gm    Gm    D
I'm hopelessly de - voted to you 
 
[Chorus]

But now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside
    Bb        Bbma7  Fdim       Fdim       Cm7     Cm7
I'm out of my head, hopelessly devoted to you

Hopelessly devoted to you
Cm7          Cdim     Gm    Gm    D
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
   D              F#m7           G          G
My head is sayin',     "Fool, forget him"
   Em7              A7            Dmaj7       D6
My heart is sayin',    "Don't let go"
D              B7  C6              B7     Em7   Em7
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do

I'm hopelessly de - voted to you
 
[Chorus]

I'm out of my head, hopelessly devoted to you
