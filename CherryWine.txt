Cherry wine. Hozier. Capo 1st fret. Or capo on 6th (G C Em, Am7)
[Intro]
C        F    C
[Verse 1]
    C                  C
Her eyes and words are so icy
            Am
Oh, but she burns
     F        C
Like rum on a fire
C                C
Hot and fast and angry
   C
As she can be
Am        F         C
I walk my days on a wire
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
F          Am   F         Am
  It looks ugly, but it's clean,
F    Am           Dm7        C
  Oh momma, don't fuss over me
 
[Chorus]
            C            Am              C
The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
     C              Am            C
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
    F                 Dm7                  C
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
 
[Verse 2]
Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
  But I want it, it's a crime
  That she's not around most of the time
 
[Chorus]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing
 
[Pre-Chorus 3]
  And it's worth it, it's divine
  And I have this some of the time
 
 
[Chorus]
