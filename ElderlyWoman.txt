Elderly Woman Behind The Counter In A Small Town,  Pearl Jam.


[Verse]
 
 D C9      G          C9       G
 I seem to recognize your face
 D   C9   G                   C9      G
 Haunting familiar yet i cant seem to place it
 D      C9       G                    C9         G
 cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
 D   C9       G           C9      G
 lifetimes of catching up with me
 
 
[Bridge]
 
 A         C9             A
 all these changes taking place
 C9                 A
 i wish id seen the place
 C9               Em
 but no ones ever takin me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 D          C9            G     C9   G
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 
 
[Verse]
 
 D C9      G              C9    G
 i swear i recognize your breath
 D     C9      G                 C9     G
 memories like finger prints are slowly raising
 D      C9        G        C9        G
 me you wouldnt recall for im not my former
 D        C9        G          C9       G
 its hard when your stuck upon the shelf
 
 
[Bridge]
 A           C9              A
 i change by not changing at all
 C9                     A
 small town predicts my fate
 C9                        Em
 perhaps thats what no one wants to see
 
 
[Verse]
 
 D      C9      G       C9  G
 i just want to scream hello
 D  C9      G             C9                 G
 by god its been so long never dreamed you'd return
 D       C9       G       C9     G
 but now here you are and here i am
 D          C9            G    C9  G
 hearts and thoughts they fade away
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 D          C9            G     C9   G
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 hearts and thoughts they fade... away
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 
Outro-lightly
 D          C9            G     C9   G
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
