Pompeii by Bastille


[Verse 1]
 
      D        A     Fm     E
I was left to my own devices
      D        A         Fm         E
Many days fell away with nothing to show
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      D
But if you close your eyes,
            A
Does it almost feels like
   Fm               E
Nothing changed at all
                       D
And if you close your eyes,
              A
Does it almost feels like
Fm                 E
You've been here before?
 
D                      A                E
Oh, how ma gonna be an optimist about this?
D                      A               E
Oh, how ma gonna be an optimist about this?
 
 
[Verse 2]
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
In your pose as the dust settled around us
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
And the walls kept tumbling down
In the city we love
Great clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      F
But if you close your eyes,
            C
Does it almost feels like
   Am               G
Nothing changed at all
                       F
And if you close your eyes,
              C
Does it almost feels like
Am                 G
You've been here before?
 
F                      C                G
Oh, how ma gonna be an optimist about this?
F                      C               G
Oh, how ma gonna be an optimist about this?
 
 
[Bridge]
 F           C   G
Oh where do we begin?
 F           C   G
The rubble or our sins?
 F           C   G
Oh where do we begin?
 F          C      G
The rubble or our sins?
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
        F                    C
And the walls kept tumbling down
                Am    G
In the city we love
      F                    C
Great clouds roll over the hills
                       Am    G
Bringing darkness from above
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                      F
But if you close your eyes,
            C
Does it almost feels like
   Am               G
Nothing changed at all
                       F
And if you close your eyes,
              C
Does it almost feels like
Am                 G
You've been here before?
 
F                      C                G
Oh, how ma gonna be an optimist about this?
F                      C               G
Oh, how ma gonna be an optimist about this?
 
                      F
But if you close your eyes,
            C
Does it almost feels like
   Am               G
Nothing changed at all
