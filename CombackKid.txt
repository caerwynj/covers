[Intro]

[Verse 1]
C             
I've been so low
G
Felt the wind blow
F
Like I was a screen door
F
In a thunderstorm
Yeah I've been down
You've been laid out
But you always were
What I came here for
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Waiting all day
Just for my say
For a bell to ring
For the first sting
Yeah I've been blue
That ain't nothing new
It's you my friend
Why I get up again
 
[Instrumental]
 
[Chorus]
I've made mistakes
And I've been hard hit
I say so what
So what if I did
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the comeback kid
 
[Verse 3]
It's been a rough year
Been some tough tears
I've lost so fast
All that I had
But when it's time to
I'll fight for you
Cause you know you are
Why I've come so far
 
[Instrumental]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]

Start it over
Start it over again
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the comeback kid
 
[Break]

[Chorus]
I've made mistakes
And I've been hard hit
I say so what
So what if I did
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the comeback kid

Start it over
Start it over again
I'm the clear eyed
I'm the comeback kid
 
[Outro]
