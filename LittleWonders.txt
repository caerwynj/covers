Little Wonders - Rob Thomas

[Intro]
A  Esus4  Bm  D6
A  Esus4  Bm  D6
 
 
[Verse 1]
      A          Esus4
Let it go, let it roll right off your shoulder
          Bm        D
Don't you know, the hardest part is over
       A            Esus4
Let it in, let your clarity define you
       Bm           D                         A
In the end, we will only just remember how it feels
 
 
[Chorus 1]
A               E                  Bm/F#
 Our lives are made in these small hours
             F#m            E                A
These little wonders, these twists and turns of fate
             E                    Bm
Time falls away but these small hours,
            D     E     A
These small hours still remain
 
 
[Interlude]
A  Esus4   Bm    D
 
 
[Verse 2]
       A                Esus4
Let it slide, let your troubles fall behind you
       Bm              Dmaj7          D
Let it shine until you feel it all around you
            A            E
And I don't mind if it's me you need to turn to
          Bm           Dmaj7             D6             A
We'll get by, it's the heart that really matters in the end
 
 
[Chorus 2]
A              E                   Bm
 Our lives are made in these small hours
             Dmaj7          E                   A
These little wonders, these twists and turns of fate
           E                    Bm
Time falls away but these small hours,
            Dmaj7 E     Bm
These small hours still remain
 
 
[Bridge]
Bm            F#m       E
  All of my regret will wash away somehow
Bm               F#m        E                A
  But I can not forget the way I feel right now
 
 
[Chorus 3]
E               Bm                  Dmaj7
 In these small hours these little wonders
      E                 D*
These twists & turns of fate
              D              A
Yeah these twists and turns of fate
           E                         Bm
Time falls away yeah but these small hours
            Dmaj9 E       A
These small hours still remain, yeah
 
 
[Outro]
E                Bm
 Oh they still remain
             Dmaj7
These little wonders
         E        Esus4     A
Oh these twists & turns of fate
           E                     Bm
Time falls away but these small hours
             D       E     A
These little wonders still remain
