Nothing Compares 2 U by Chris Cornell
[Intro]
 
C  G/B  Am  C G x2
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C                           G/B
  It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Am                              C  G
  since you took your love away
C                        G/B
  I go out all night and sleep all day
Am7                             C  G
  since you took your love away
 
C                                  G/B
  Since you been gone I can do whatever I want
Am7                          C  G
  I can see whoever I choose
C                                G/B              Am7
  I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant - but nothing
Am                E
Nothing can take away these blues
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       Bb         F
'Cause nothing compares
Bb          F     G
  Nothing compares to you
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C                         G/B
  It's been so lonely without you here
Am7                         C  G
  like a bird without a song
C                               G/B
  Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
       Am7              F   Fsus4
Tell me baby, where did I go wrong?
 
C                                G/B
  I could put my arms around any girl I choose
Am7                             C  G
  but it just reminds me of you
C                                        G/B
  I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me
        Am7
He said boy, you better try to have fun
          E
no matter what you do,
 
but he's a fool
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       Bb         F
'Cause nothing compares
Am           G
  Nothing compares to you
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
C G/B Am C G
C G/B Am E
Bb F Am G Em G
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
C                                    G/B
All the flowers that you planted mama, in your backyard
Am7                          C  G
  all died when you went away
C                               G/B
  I know living with me baby is sometimes hard
Am7                                  E
  but I'm willing to give it another try
 
 
[Chorus]
 
       Bb         F
'Cause nothing compares
Am           G
  Nothing compares to you
Bb         F
Nothing compares
Am           G
  Nothing compares to you
Em        G
   To you
