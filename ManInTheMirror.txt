[Verse]
 
G         D/F#          Em  D              C
I'm gonna make a change,    for once in my life
           G         D/F#               Em          D             C
It's gonna feel real good, gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
     G        D/F#         Em            D           C
As I, turn up the collar on  my favorite winter coat, this wind is blowin' my mind
          G           D/F#             Em            D
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
          C
Who am I, to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
 
Am7                  G/B
 A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
C                 G/B
 And a one man's soul
     Am7                      G/B
They follow each other on the wind ya' know
            C                 D
'Cause they got nowhere to go
                              G
That's why I want you to know
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G    G/B               C          D
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G    G/B           C          D
 I'm asking him to change his ways
G       G/B                C        A/C#
 And no message could have been any clearer
         D7
 If you wanna make the world a better place
                                               G  D/F#
 Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em         D                 C                 D
  Na na na,  na na na na, na na, na na, uh-huh
 
 
[Verse]
 
G           D/F#      Em        D            C
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love, It's time that I realize
          G            D/F#        Em             D
There are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
            C
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?
 
Am7                     G/B
 A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
C                 G/B
 And a washed-out dream
     Am7                       G/B
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see
            C                 D
'Cause they got no place to be
                               G
That's why I'm starting with me
 
[Chorus]
 
G    G/B               C          D
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G    G/B           C          D
 I'm asking him to change his ways
G       G/B                C        A/C#
 And no message could have been any clearer
         Dm
 If you wanna make the world a better place
                                               G  D/F#
 Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
 
G    G/B               C          D
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
G    G/B           C          D
 I'm asking him to change his ways
G       G/B                C        A/C#
 And no message could have been any clearer
         Dm
 If you wanna make the world a better place
                                               G  D/F#
 Take a look at yourself, and then make a change
