[Verse 1]
E               A     Asus4 A
Sheets of empty canvas
          E             A Asus4 A
untouched sheets of clay
E                 A
lay spread out before me
       E
as her body once did
E           A     Asus4 A
All five horizons,
          E             A                     Asus4 A
revolved around her soul (as the earth to the sun)
E             A
Now the air I tasted and breathed,
    E
has taken a turn
     C                                Em
Oooh and all I taught her was... everything
     C                               Em
Oooh all I know she gave all... that sheee wore
 
[Hook]
           D
And now my bitter hands
        C
chafe beneath the clouds
                 Em
Of what was everything
        D                      C
All the pictures have all been washed in black
             Em
Tatooed everything.
 
[Verse 2]
  E      A           Asus4 A
I take a walk outside
       E               A            Asus4 A
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
E                A
I can feel their laughter
   E
So why do i seer
    C                                       Em
Ooh and twisted thoughts they spin round my head (I'm spinnin')
         C                                    Em
Oooh I'm spinning how quick the sun can drop awayayayayay
 
[Hook]
           D
And now my bitter hands
       C
cradle broken glass
                 Em
of what was everything
       D                      C
All my pictures have all been washed in black
             Em
Tatooed everything
 
[Verse 3]
       D
All my love gone bad
          C
turned my world to black
            D
tatooed all I see
         C
All that I am
              Em     D           C
All I'll ever beeeeeeee    yeaahheah
 
Em    D    C
 
  Em
I know some day you'll have a beautiful life
  D
I know you'll be a sun,
   C                       Em              D
In somebody elses sky, but whyhy, whyhy   whyhy
         C                  Em
can't it be, oh can't it be mine.
