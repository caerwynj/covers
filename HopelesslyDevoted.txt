[Verse 1]
      A               C#m7        D         D
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
   Bm7              E7       Amaj7       A6
My eyes are not the first to cry
    A                F#7          G6              F#7  Bm7   Bm7  C#m7  Cm7  Bm7
I'm not the first to know there's just no gettin' over you
 
  A               C#m7       D         D
I know I'm just a fool who's willing
   Bm7            E7       Amaj7       A6
To sit around and wait for you
     A               F#7         G6               F#7   Bm7   Bm7
But, baby, can't you see there's nothin' else for me to do
    C#m7       Cm7  Bm7      Dm    Dm    A
I'm hopelessly de - voted to you 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.            Gm7        Gm7            Gm7            C7  (Caug)
But now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside
    F         Fma7  Cdim       Cdim       Gm7     Gm7
I'm out of my head, hopelessly devoted to you
Gdim       Gdim       Dm    Dm/C#    Dm/C    Dm/B
Hopelessly devoted to you
Gm7          Gdim     Dm    Dm    A
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
   A              C#m7           D          D
My head is sayin',     "Fool, forget him"
   Bm7              E7            Amaj7       A6
My heart is sayin',    "Don't let go"
A              F#7  G6              F#7     Bm7   Bm7
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do
    C#m7       Cm7  Bm7      Dm    Dm   A
I'm hopelessly de - voted to you
 
[Chorus]
N.C.            Gm7        Gm7            Gm7            C7  (Caug)
But now there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside
    F         Fma7  Cdim       Cdim       Gm7     Gm7
I'm out of my head, hopelessly devoted to you
Gdim       Gdim       Dm    Dm/C#    Dm/C    Dm/B
Hopelessly devoted to you
Gm7          Gdim     Bbm    Bbm    F
