Los Angeles, The Midnight

[Verse 1]
 
A
Fire on the beach
D
Face to the sky
    F#m             E                  D
The stars dance around like gods in disguise
 
    A
The gold silhouette
    D
You take off your clothes
       F#m              E               D
And my heart feels the weight of all I don't know
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
A
Memories and mountain tops
           D
Drunk on Sunset Boulevard
F#m                E             D
With the city of angels singing on
 
A
Maybe this is just a dream
            D
And maybe we are still asleep
   F#m         E                  D
But I, I will miss you when I'm gone
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Flickers of the canyon fire
D
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
       F#m                  E               D
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
A
Helicopters against the moonlight
D
Our holy mother of the midnight
           F#m                   E              D
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
[Verse 2]
 
   A
Tomorrow we'll go
 D
Back to our lives
      F#m          E                 D
With sand in our skin and sun in our eyes
 
    A
But I know the truth
       D
I've seen the signs
    F#m            E               D
And I've seen the golden gods in disguise
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
A
Memories and mountain tops
           D
Drunk on Sunset Boulevard
F#m                E             D
With the city of angels singing on
 
A
Maybe this is just a dream
            D
And maybe we are still asleep
   F#m         E                  D
But I, I will miss you when I'm gone
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Flickers of the canyon fire
D
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
       F#m                  E               D
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
A
Helicopters against the moonlight
D
Our holy mother of the midnight
           F#m                   E              D
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
A
Flickers of the canyon fire
D
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
       F#m                  E               D
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
A
Helicopters against the moonlight
D
Our holy mother of the midnight
           F#m                   E              D
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
A
Flickers of the canyon fire
D
Its hands raised like a gospel choir
       F#m                  E               D
If we live forever, let us live forever tonight
 
A
Helicopters against the moonlight
D
Our holy mother of the midnight
           F#m                   E              D
And if we live forever, let us live forever tonight
