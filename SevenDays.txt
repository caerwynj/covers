Seven Days - Sting

[Verse 1]
Cmaj7
"Seven days" was all she wrote
   Eb         Bb
A kind of ultimatum note
     G               F         Fadd9
She gave to me, she gave to me
 
Cmaj7
When I thought the field had cleared
    Eb            Bb
It seems another suit appeared
     G           Eadd9
To challenge me, woe is me
 
 Cmaj7
Though I hate to make a choice
    Eb            Bb              G
My options are decreasing mostly rapidly
 F              Fadd9
Well, we'll see
 
Cmaj7
I don't think she'd bluff this time
   Eb             Bb
I really have to make her mine
      G
It's plain to see
      E        E7
It's him or me
 
 
[Chorus]
 Fmaj7  F#m7b5            G
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
   E7/G#         Am
If I make up my mind
 Fmaj7              G     E7/G#            Am
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
C7/Bb           Am    C7/Bb         Am
Friday give me time, Saturday could wait
     Fm              Cmaj7
But Sunday'd be too late
 
 
[Verse 2]
Cmaj7
The fact he's over six feet ten
      Eb               Bb
Might instill fear in other men
     G              F                  Fadd9
But not in me, The Mighty Flea (flee?)
 
Cmaj7
Ask if I am mouse or man
     Eb               Bb
The mirror squeaked, away I ran
       G            Eadd9
He'll murder me in time for his tea
 
Cmaj7
Does it bother me at all
    Eb        Bb             G
My rival is Neanderthal, it makes me think
   F                   Fadd9
Perhaps I need a drink
 
Cmaj7
IQ is no problem here
   Eb                 Bb              G
We won't be playing scrabble for her hand I fear
   E             E7
I need that beer
 
 
[Chorus]
 Fmaj7  F#m7b5            G
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
   E7/G#         Am
If I make up my mind
 Fmaj7              G     E7/G#            Am
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
C7/Bb           Am    C7/Bb         Am
Friday give me time, Saturday could wait
     Fm              Cmaj7
But Sunday'd be too late
 
 
[Bridge]
Bb               Cmaj7
Seven days will quickly go
Bb                   Cmaj7
The fact remains, I love her so
Bb         F
Seven days, so many ways
Bb              Cmaj7
But I can't run away
 
 
[Chorus]
 Fmaj7  F#m7b5            G
Monday, I could wait till Tuesday
   E7/G#         Am
If I make up my mind
 Fmaj7              G     E7/G#            Am
Wednesday would be fine, Thursday's on my mind
C7/Bb           Am    C7/Bb         Am
Friday give me time, Saturday could wait
     Fm              Cmaj7
But Sunday'd be too late
 
 
[Outro]
      Cmaj7
Do I have to tell a story
      Bb                                Cmaj7  Bb
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met
       Cmaj7
It's a big enough umbrella
         Bb                             Cmaj7  Bb  C
But it's always me that ends up getting wet
 
 
Cmaj7      x32000  but I think x35453 sounds better
Eb         x68886
Bb         x13331
G          320003  or 355433
F          133211
Fadd9      xx3213  but  xx3011 will do the job :)
E          022100
Fmaj7      xx3210
F#m7b5     xx4210  (just add your pinky to the previous chord)
E7/G#      420100
Am         x02210
C7/Bb      x12310
Fm         133111
