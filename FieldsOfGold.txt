Fields of Gold by Sting

[Verse 1]
         Bm                    G
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G      D
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A             Bm7 G D
As we walk in fields of gold
 
[Verse 2]
So she took her love for to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
     G/B   A           D
Among the fields of gold
 
[Verse 3]
Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A           Bm7 G D
As we lie in fields of gold
  
[Verse 4]
See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
     G/B   A          D
Among the fields of gold

[Bridge]
G             D
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

[Verse 5]
Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
     G/B  A          D
Among the fields of gold
 
[Verse 6]
Bsus2                        G
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
                    D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                 G       D
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
         G/B       A          D
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
