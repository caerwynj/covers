Fields of Gold by Sting

[Verse 1]
         Bm                    G
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G      D
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A             Bm7 G D
As we walk in fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 2]
       Bm                     G
So she took her love for to gaze awhile
                      D
Upon the fields of barley
     Bm                      G         D
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
     G/B   A           D
Among the fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 3]
       Bm                       G
Will you stay with me, will you be my love
                        D
Among the fields of barley
       Bm                     G       D
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
      G/B      A           Bm7 G D
As we lie in fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 4]
         Bm                     G
See the west wind move like a lover so
                     D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                  G         D
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
     G/B   A          D
Among the fields of gold
 
 
[Bridge]
G             D
I never made promises lightly
G                   D
And there have been some that I've broken
G                  D
But I swear in the days still left
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold
       G/B     A          D
We'll walk in fields of gold

[Verse 5]
      Bm                              G
Many years have passed since those summer days
                      D
Among the fields of barley
      Bm                     G        D
See the children run as the sun goes down
     G/B  A          D
Among the fields of gold
 
 
[Verse 6]
Bsus2                        G
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
                    D
Upon the fields of barley
         Bm                 G       D
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
         G/B       A          D
When we walked in fields of gold
         G/B       A          D
When we walked in fields of gold
         G/B       A
When we walked in fields of gold
