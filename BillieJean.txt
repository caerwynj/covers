Em
   She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen
                                                 Am
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
                                   Em
Who will dance on the floor in the round
                  Am                                      C      C - Dadd4add9
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
Em
She said her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
                                                           Am
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
                                Em
Who will dance on the floor and round
 
[Pre-chorus]
C                        Em
  People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
    C                        Em
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
       C                                 B7
And be careful of what you do before the lie becomes the truth
 
[Chorus]
Em        Am      Em
   Billie Jean is not my lover
          Am     Em
She's just a girl 
                 Am        Bmadd11/A
Who says that I am the one
        C/A    D/A     Em
But the kid is not my son
           Am         Bmadd11/A
She says I am the one
        C/A    D/A     Em   Eadd#11 (no3)
But the kid is not my son
 
[Verse 2]
Em
   For forty days and for forty nights the law was on her side
                                                  Am
But who can stand when she's in demand her schemes and plans
                             Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
                 Am                                   C                     Dadd4add9
So take my strong advice and remember to always think twice (do think twice)
 
[Verse 3]
Em
   She told my baby that we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
                                                 Am
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine
                                    Em
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
 
[Pre-chorus]
C                          Em
  People always told me be careful of what you do
      C                               Em
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
C                      Em
Then she stood right by me, her smell sweet perfume
C                                     B7
  This happened much too soon but she called me to her room
 
[Chorus]
Em        Am      Em
   Billie Jean is not my lover
          Am     Em
She's just a girl 
                 Am        Bmadd11/A
Who says that I am the one
        C/A    D/A     Em
But the kid is not my son
           Am         Bmadd11/A
She says I am the one
        C/A    D/A     Em   Eadd#11 (no3)
But the kid is not my son
 
[Solo]
C - Em - C - Em - C - Em - C - B7
 
[Chorus]
Em        Am      Em
   Billie Jean is not my lover
          Am     Em
She's just a girl
               Am          Bmadd11/A
Who says that I am the one
        C/A    D/A     Em
But the kid is not my son
          Am          Bmadd11/A
She says I am the one
        C/A    D/A     C
But the kid is not my son
                      Am  Bmadd11/A        C/G       D/A           Em    Eadd#11 (no3)
