[Intro]
G  C  Em7  D
G  C  Em7  D
[Verse]
G                    C                      Em7     D
   From walkin' home and talkin' loads  
G               C                           Em7     D
   Seein' chirps in evenin' clothes with you
G                    C                      Em7     D
   From nervous touch and gettin' drunk
G               C                           Em7     D
   To stayin' up and wakin' up with you
 
[Pre-Chorus]
              Em
And now we're slippin' at the edge
D                          Em/C#           Cmaj
Holdin' somethin' we don't need
            Em
Oh, this delusion in our heads
D                          Em/C#
Is gonna bring us to our knees
 
[Chorus]
                 C         G
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Em          D
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  Am        G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              D
And I'll be me
 
                    C         G
Everything's that's broooooke
                Em         D
Leave it to the breeeeeeeeze
                 Am        G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
             D
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
 
[Instrumental]
G  C  Em7  D
G  C  Em7  D
 
[Verse]
G                        C                 Em7   D
    From throwin' clothes across the floor
G                        C                         Em7   D
    To teeth and clothes and slammin' doors at you
G                       C                         Em7   D
    If this is all we're livin' for
           G                    C                 Em7   D
Why are we doin' it, doin' it, doin' it anymore
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
           Em              D
I used to recognize myself
                             Em/C#      Cmaj
It's funny how reflections change
            Em                   D
And we're becomin' somethin' else
                          Em/C#
I think it's time to walk away
 
[Chorus]
                  C         G
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Em          D
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  Am        G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              D
And I'll be me
 
                    C         G
Everything's that's broooooke
                Em         D
Leave it to the breeeeeeeeze
                 Am        G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
             D
And I'll be me
And I'll be me
 
 
[Instrumental]
G  C  Em7  D
 
[Bridge]
Am                                 G
Tryin' to fit your hand inside of mine
G
When we know it just don't belong
D
There's no force on earth
                   Em
Could make me feel right, no    Whoa
 
Am                                 G
Tryin' to push this problem up the hill
G
When it's just too heavy to hold
D                              Em
Think now's the time to let it slide
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                  C         G
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Em7         D
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  C        G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              D
And I'll be me
 
                    C        G
Everything's that's broooooooke
                 Em7        D
Leave it to the breeeeeeeeeeeze
               C           G
Let the ashes faaaaaaaaalllll
              D
Forget about me
 
                  C         G
So come on let it gooooooooo
            Em7         D
Just let it beeeeeeeeee
                  C        G
Why don't you be youuuuuuuu
              D
And I'll be me
             G
And I'll be me
